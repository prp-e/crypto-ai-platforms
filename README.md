# AI Platforms and Services accepting cryptocurrencies

Since AI platforms are making a trend in recent years, we witness that a lot of people may not be able to pay fiat currencies due to different problems. In this repository, I gathered every single platform or service provider where you can do a payment with the cryptocurrency or token of your choice. 

## How to contribute 

To contribute to this list, you must follow these rules: 

- The platform or service must be accepting cryptocurrency as at least one of their payment methods. 
- No airdrop or cloud-mining please. Even if it is an AI utility token. This is not a _scam promoting project_ but a neat effort in gathering legit projects at one place. 
- If you own the project, providng a little bit of information in your pull-request about the history of your project would be helpful.
